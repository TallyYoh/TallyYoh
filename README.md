👋 Hi, I’m @TallyYoh

- 🌱 I’m a postdoctoral researcher at the Durrell Institute for Conservation & Ecology
- 🍖 My current research focuses on urban wildmeat consumption in Central & West Africa
  
      Understanding why people consume wildmeat in urban Africa
      How it can be done sustainably
      How we can safeguard human health from disease spillover risk
  
- 🦗 I am also very interested in how we can use and improve acoustic tools for monitoring biodiversity
